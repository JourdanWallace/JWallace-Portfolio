        <!-- What I am doing for my first assignment in the App Academy-->
        <p>Our first project in the App Academy is creating 
            and designing our own website.We had to start from scratch
            and link multiple pages together using the tag "href".
            We also had to input pictures and add color and
            borders to our websites to make them look nice and presentable. 
            Adding pictures to my project was a little difficult but 
            watching all the videos helped me figure out what to do. 
            The reason we're building websites is to become familiar 
            with and know how to use the different tags to make our programs work.
            Overall, this is a very fun first project to start the school year.</p>
