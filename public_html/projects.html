        <h1>Projects</h1>
        <p>Our first project in the app academy is basically creating 
            and designing our own website.We had to start from scratch
            and link multiple pages together using the tag "href".
            We also had to input pictures and add color and
            borders to our websites to make them look nice and presentable. 
            Adding pictures to my project was a little difficult but 
            I watched all the videos to help me figure out what to do. 
            The reason we're building websites is to basically get familiar 
            with and know how to use the different tags to make your program work.
            I think overall, this is a very fun first project to start the school year.</p>
